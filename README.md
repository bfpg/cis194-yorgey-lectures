# BFPG talk series based on the CIS194 lecture series

## The group

We're a functional programming group in Brisbane, Australia.

  http://www.bfpg.org

We meet up for a couple of talks on the 3rd Tuesday of every month, and we have a Hack Night on the following Wednesday (8 days later).

If you're in Brisbane and interested in functional programming, you should come along.

## The course

We've been giving talks following CIS194 "Introduction to Haskell" from UPenn, giving one talk a month based on a lecture from the course.

We're basing it on Brent Yorgey's notes, which are available here:

Although Richard Eisenberg has been running a version of it this year that looks similarly excellent:

  http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/index.html

It's a great course which is fantastic for coming up to speed with Haskell.
It links the relevant extra reading (such as Learn You a Haskell For Great Good, Real World Haskell, Typeclassopedia, etc...), and it comes with some interesting homework exercises.

## The talks

Huge thanks are due to Rob Manthey for recording, processing and uploading these videos.
